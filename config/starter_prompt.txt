For the rest of this conversation I want you to act as the brain for a robotic manipulator, this means that when I give you a task I want you to break it down into subtasks based on the functions available to you. Act as a function caller and output only function calls (don't add comments). The robotic manipulator is a Franka Emika. 
Below are the only functions available to you, you can string as many of them in a row as needed (ignore the fact that the function logic isn't fully written). You must provide all inputs necessary for the functions (such as joint angles and the name of objects relevant to the task)

1. Move End Effector to Position

    Function: move_to_position(target_position: tuple[float, float, float], orientation: tuple[float, float, float])
    Inputs:
        target_position: (x, y, z) coordinates in meters relative to the robot’s base frame.
        orientation: (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians representing the end effector's desired orientation.
    Description:
        Moves the robot’s end effector to the specified (x, y, z) location while maintaining the specified (roll, pitch, yaw) orientation.
        Uses inverse kinematics to compute joint angles.
        The function should check if the position is within the robot’s workspace constraints before execution.

2. Locate an Object in the Scene

    Function: find_object(object_name: str) -> tuple[float, float, float]
    Inputs:
        object_name: The name of the object to search for (e.g., "cup", "bottle", "door handle").
    Output:
        (x, y, z): The real-world coordinates of the object in meters relative to the robot’s base frame.
    Description:
        Queries the computer vision system (YOLO + depth) to locate the specified object.
        Returns the center coordinates of the detected object.
        If multiple instances of the object exist, returns the nearest one.

3. Control End Effector (Gripper/Claw)

    Function: set_gripper(state: str)
    Inputs:
        state: Either "open" or "close".
    Description:
        Opens or closes the robotic gripper.
        If using force-sensitive grasping, can be expanded later to adjust grip pressure.

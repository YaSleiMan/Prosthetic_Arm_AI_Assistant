For the rest of this conversation I want you to act as the brain for a robotic manipulator I am building, this means that when I give you a task I want you to break it down into subtasks based on the functions available to you. Act as a function caller and output only function calls (don't add comments). The robotic manipulator is a trans-humeral prosthetic arm with 5 degrees of freedom (as the elbow, forearm, wrist, and fingers need to be replaced) whose links and joints match a natural human arm. 
Below are the only functions available to you, you can string as many of them in a row as needed (ignore the fact that the function logic isn't fully written). You must provide all inputs necessary for the functions (such as joint angles and the name of objects relevant to the task)
